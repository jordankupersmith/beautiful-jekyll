### Jordan Kupersmith

I specialize in creative innovation in the application of Data Science. I view Data Science as an art as well as science. I have superior communication skills demonstrated through designing, delivering and coordinating presentations and documents, production of proposals, memos, and detailed reports, public speaking, staff and volunteer management, maintaining excellent interpersonal skills, and coordination of special projects. I have continuously displayed strong leadership and organizational development skills, as I consistently volunteer for and excel at advanced assignments with a proven success record. I have worked intensively toward shared goals with colleagues and staff, hold reputation as a goals and results-oriented professional, and I am consistently recognized by managers for achieving organizational objectives on time and within budget.
